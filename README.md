# Wide Awake: Prototype of a mobile app that predicts home fire and notifies the elderly and their carers when smoke/fire is detected
This was designed as a university project with a focus on elderly-centred UI/UX design. This app serves as a warning alert system for future fires and allows users to prevent deaths or fire-related injuries from happening. 

## I. Motivation
Senior citizens aged 60 and above are at a greater risk of injury or death from home fires due to poor health, whether mental or physical, and other behavioral reasons. While smartphones can help, they are usually designed for younger people. And for fire alarms to be useful, they should be working properly and installed in the living room or bedroom where fires most commonly start. Wide awake was designed to bridge this gap, a fire prediction mobile app that detects smoke and fire in real-time and immediately alerts the elderly and their carers.

## II. Goal
To design a home-fire prediction smartphone app for the elderly using sensor and camera aided by Artificial Intelligence to protect the elderly from fires in their homes.  

## III. **Features of the app** 
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Fire-and-smoke-detection** | This is based on video camera through the use of YOLOv2 model with Convolutional Neural Network that has a faster speed in image processing and sends real-time alert to the elderlies, their carers, and the fire emergency department if the fire or smoke detected is not yet made known to them by the elderly for more than 2 minutes since the fire/smoke started. |
| **Voice command** | This feature can be activated on the Settings by the elderly to alert them using an alarm sound and voice that there is a fire/smoke in their house. |
| **Audio detection** | This feature detects sound of something being burned. |
| **Global positioning statement (GPS)** | This tracks the  location of the elderly. |
| **Messaging feature** | This feature sends the elderly six customised fire related questions per day to know their condition inside their homes. |
| **Fire risk assessment** and **prevention tips** | Used for evaluating their homes and pointers on how to avoid fire. |

## IV. Design Rationale
This project intends to make the mobile application elderly-friendly; thus, matching the app’s design interface with the elderly’s needs, requirements, or expectations. Their preferences on what should appear on the user interface cannot be ignored. Such matters include: the length and size of the text; graphics; kinds, locations and size of icons; and color schemes for contents and 
background. Behind these considerations are reasons given by researchers which usually point to older people’s mental and physical state including their poor or failing vision due to old age.  The following elements are used in Wide Awake’s implementation: 
| Elements | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Simplicity** | The design of the app is easy to understand, plain, use of minimum words as much as possible and the commands used are simple, not complex, to avoid confusion on the part of the user. For the elderly, usage of long-term memory which is linked to previous experiences is more helpful than short term memory which is related to discovering something different/new. Thus, user interface should apply graphics or functions that the elderly can relate to or identify with. Using pictures, photographs and a combination of both for menu icon for the elderly proved that even with decreasing ability to see, many old people are inclined to read the menu label so the menu label should use simple icons that could readily be understood by the user. Highlighted in this design are important menu buttons that could help the elderly as they are represented by simple familiar pictorial icons labelled with text in large font size appropriate for the elderly’s vision. Due to poor or declining visual ability, older adults prefer the following:  black and bigger font of text; colored text and graphics to highlight significant data; soft color which brings joy to the elderly using the application;  and clear and large graphics, buttons and icons so that senior citizens can click them error-free. |
| **Learnability** | The user interface is designed based on the ability of the user to understand how the mobile phone functions/operates. A study had been conducted on how older people navigate mobile interfaces while they determine usability challenges at the same time. Results showed that the respondents/participants had better chances of understanding the contents rather than the menus and icons of the navigation design and this finding can be a valuable consideration in the development of elderly-friendly mobile application.  |
| **Consistency** | The design of the user interface is dependable, meaning, it would not create any confusion when the elderly uses her mobile phone. In one study intended to find out the accessibility of social media mobile application interface for the elderly, results showed that what can be seen could easily be dealt with as compared with mental or intellectual issues. Proposed guidelines by the research would focus on color schemes, size of font, space and button of app. Cognitive issues still needed further study for the necessary guidelines.  |
| **Structure Principle** | The user interface is structured clearly, where similar/related things are arranged together and those that are not connected are not put together. Also, reliable models that are obvious and can easily be identified are used. Brightness, colour, and font are primarily considered in the design of the app since they influence the success and effortless smartphone usage of senior citizens. It need not be emphasized that as people grow old, they may have impaired eyesight or distorted vision; thus, viewing contents on the screen might take much longer time or even result in wrong interpretations.|

Overall, I intend to create an app that can protect old people and spare them from injuries, near-death experiences and even death itself when the monster known as fire visits their homes.
