# Wide Awake: A Mobile app prototype that predicts home fire and notifies the elderly and their carers when smoke/fire is detected
This app serves as a warning alert system for future fires and allows users to prevent deaths or fire-related injuries from happening. It will be released on both iOS and Android.

## Motivation
The primary motivation behind Wide Awake app is the fire safety of the elderly. Should fires occur in their homes, older people whose ages range from 60 years or more (Cassidy et al., 2021, Salman et al., 2022) have greater possibilities of succumbing to death or having injuries due to poor health, whether mental or physical, or other behavioral reasons (Karemaker et al., 2021). It is therefore of paramount importance to maintain safety measures that can effectively help the elderly avoid death or injury by fire in their own houses (Karemaker et al., 2021). To be useful to senior citizens, fire alarms in their homes should be working properly and installed in the living room or bedroom where fires usually happen (Cassidy et al., 2021). Smartphones can help the elderly but they are usually designed for younger people; thus, senior citizens may have difficulty in navigating/using the user interface of such gadgets (Awan et al., 2021). The elderly can be confused and/or baffled by new technologies due to age-related problems, physical abilities, memory decline, mental models, cognitive or sensory functions, and the design of smartphone apps may not have considered their needs or requirements (Awan et al., 2021). 

The features of the Wide Awake app are the following: 
1)Fire-and-smoke-detection which is based on video camera through the use of YOLOv2 model with Convolutional Neural Network that has a faster speed in image processing (Saponara et al., 2021) and sends real-time alert to the elderlies, their carers, and the fire emergency department if the fire or smoke detected is not yet made known to them by the elderly for more than 2 minutes since the fire/smoke started;
2) Voice command feature can be activated on the Settings by the elderly to alert them using an alarm sound and voice that there is a fire/smoke in their house,
3) Audio detection feature detects sound of something being burned. This is similar to Google Nest feature (Google Nest, n.d.);
4) Global positioning statement (GPS) - tracks the  location of the elderly;
5) Messaging feature - sends the elderly six customised fire related questions per day to know their condition inside their homes. This is like the Snug Safety app feature (Snug Safe, n.d., Snug Safety, n.d.); and
6) Fire risk assessment (similar to Fire Guard app feature (Fire Guard, n.d.)) and prevention 
tips for evaluating their homes and pointers on how to avoid fire.

Overall, this project aims to design a home-fire prediction smartphone app for the elderly using sensor and camera aided by Artificial Intelligence to protect the elderly from fires in their homes.
